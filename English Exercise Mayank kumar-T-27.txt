Simple Future Tense Exercise

Read the text below.

How will life be in the future?
Well, I think life in the future will be very different. All houses 
will have appliances that use solar energy. Vehicles will also work
on solar or electric energy. We will see robots at home, at office, at 
malls, restaurants and everywhere we go. Domestic robots will
clean, cook, drive and will even help look after children. Everyone 
will own a computer. Students will not go to school anymore. 
Instead, they will attend a virtual class. They will have lessons on 
the computer. I think people will have more free time. They will
travel more. Everyone will use electric vehicles or solar vehicles 
with robot drivers. In the future, I think people will go on holidays 
to the moon in space rockets, and if they are very rich, they will buy
some land on other planets too! Space tourism will become very 
popular!

Will Be
Read the text below.
In 2050, our life will be a lot different. The environment, 
education and people's lifestyle will be at a new level. Of course, 
there will be reasons to be optimistic about life then. Along with 
scientific advances, there will be more means of transport. Vehicles 
will be solar-powered or wind-powered. They will be more 
environment-friendly. Travelling to other planets will be possible 
for everyone. In addition, everyone will be educated, and it will be
affordable for all. There will be robots helping people at home and 
outside. So people will be lazy and less healthy. In the next 30-40 
years, there will be lots of changes in our life. Whether it will be
better or worse depends on how the changes influence our life.
